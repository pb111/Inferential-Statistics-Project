# Inferential Statistics with Python Project

**Inferential Statistics** is the process of drawing inferences about the population from the sample data. Inferential Statistics is used to draw inferences from the data that are not immediately available. In this project, I have discussed the inferential statistical concepts and their practical applications. In particular, I have discussed `Central Limit Theorem`, `Hypothesis Testing`, `Types of errors in hypothesis testing`, `z  test`, `t  test`, `ANOVA` , `Chi-square goodness of fit test` and `Correlation coefficient`.

## 1. Introduction to Inferential Statistics


Inferential statistics is the branch of statistics that allows us to draw inferences about the population data from the sample data. Inferential statistics help us to conclude whether a sample is significantly different from the population. They help us to find if one model is significantly better than the other. They help us to conduct hypothesis testing.


There are a number of techniques to draw inferences from the sample data. The most important ones are `hypothesis testing`, `z test`,
`t test`, `ANOVA` and `Chi-square goodness of fit test`. In this project, I will discuss these techniques. At first, I will start the discussion by discussing sample and population.
