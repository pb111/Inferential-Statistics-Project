# Inferential Statistics with Python Project

**Inferential Statistics** is the process of drawing inferences about the population from the sample data. Inferential Statistics is used to draw inferences from the data that are not immediately available. In this project, I have discussed the inferential statistical concepts and their practical applications. In particular, I have discussed `Central Limit Theorem`, `Hypothesis Testing`, `Types of errors in hypothesis testing`, `z  test`, `t  test`, `ANOVA` , `Chi-square goodness of fit test` and `Correlation coefficient`.
